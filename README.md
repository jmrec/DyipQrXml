# DyipQr: A Commuter's Guide to Baguio City

DyipQr is a mobile application focused on solving the "big hairy audacious problem" of public commuting in Baguio City, where unpredictable jeepney routes can spoil the travel experience for locals and tourists alike. This project aims to enhance the reliability of the city's public transport system by providing a clear and convenient guide for all commuters.

## The Problem
Commuters in Baguio face daily uncertainties, such as jeepneys deviating from their usual routes, the inconvenience of determining the best way to a destination, and the unreliability of generic mapping tools like Google Maps. These issues can lead to incidents like getting lost and creating a stressful travel experience.

## Our Solution
We are creating a Baguio-exclusive map designed to provide a hassle-free public commuting experience. The application will serve as a reliable guide to help users navigate the complexities of the city's transport system.

## Key Features
- Time Estimation: Estimate vehicle arrival and departure times, as well as the travel time between stations.
- Station Display: Clearly show all the stations for a specific vehicle's route.
- Route Adherence: Visually indicate if a vehicle is following its usual route.
- Offline Mode: Ensure the map is accessible even without a constant internet connection.
- User Contributions: Allow the community to easily contribute to map data, keeping it accurate and up-to-date.
